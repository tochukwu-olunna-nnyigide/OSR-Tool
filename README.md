# OSR-Tool
OSR-Tool is a web-based application designed for processing and analyzing oscillatory shear rheology data. It enables experimental rheologists and specialists in computational or simulated oscillatory shear to extract key rheological parameters—such as G', G'', and more than 20 other metrics—from time–strain–stress data.
